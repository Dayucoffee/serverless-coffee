AutoNode Serverless: Automating Deployment of a Serverless CRUD REST API with Node.js
=====================================================================================

Introduction
------------

This guide demonstrates how to automate the deployment of a serverless CRUD REST API using Node.js, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Serverless Framework, and GitHub Actions CI/CD. You'll build a Coffee Shop API to handle coffee orders.

Prerequisites
-------------

*   Node.js and npm installed
    
*   AWS CLI configured with access to your AWS account
    
*   Serverless Framework installed globally
    

Use Case Scenario: Coffee Shop API
----------------------------------

Alyx realizes in recent years, serverless architecture has emerged as a powerful and efficient way to build backends for web applications, offering a more modern approach to web application development. Applying what she recently learned of the fundamentals of AWS serverless — “serverless doesn’t mean there are no servers involved, rather, it just abstracts away the management and provisioning of servers”, she wants to focus solely on writing code and implementing business logic.

Let’s check out how Alyx, the owner of a thriving online coffee shop, begins to leverage a serverless architecture for the backend of her web application.

Alyx’s Coffee Haven, an online coffee shop, offers an array of coffee blends and treats. Initially, Alyx manages the shop’s orders and inventory with traditional web hosting services and operations, where she handles multiple servers and resources. As her coffee shop gains popularity, she faces an increasing number of orders, especially during peak hours and seasonal promotions.

Managing the servers and ensuring the application can handle the surge in traffic becomes a challenge for Alyx. She finds herself constantly worrying about server capacity, scalability and the cost of maintaining the infrastructure. Additionally, she wishes to introduce new features like personalized recommendations and loyalty programs, but this has implement become a daunting task given the limitations of her traditional setup.

That’s when Alyx stumbles upon the concept of serverless. She likens a serverless backend as a barista that automatically brews coffee in real-time, without her having to worry about the intricate details of the coffee-making process.

Excited by this idea, Alyx decides to migrate her coffee shop’s backend to a serverless platform using AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway and Amazon DynamoDB so she can focus more on crafting the perfect coffee blends and treats for her customers.

With serverless, each customer’s order becomes an event that triggers a series of serverless functions. AWS Lambda processes the orders and handles all the business logic behind the scenes. For instance, it creates an customer’s order and is able to retrieve that order, it can also delete someones order or update an order’s status.

Alyx no longer needs to worry about managing servers, as the serverless platform automatically scales up and down based on incoming order request. Moreover, the cost-efficiency of serverless is huge for Alyx. With a pay-as-you-go model, she only pays for the actual compute time her functions consume, offering her a more a cost-effective solution for her growing business.

But she doesn't stop there! She wants to automate everything, from deploying infrastructure to updating her application whenever there's a new change. By utilizing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with the Serverless Framework, she can define all her infrastructure in code and manage it easily. On top of that, she sets up GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), so that every change she makes is automatically deployed through a pipeline, whether it's a new feature in development or a hotfix for production.

Objectives
----------

1.  Set up Serverless Framework environment
    
2.  Define API in the YAML file
    
3.  Develop AWS Lambda functions to process CRUD operations
    
4.  Set up multi-stage deployments for DEV and PROD
    
5.  Testing the Dev and Prod pipelines
    
6.  Test and Validate Prod and Dev APIs using Postman
    

Step 0: Clone the Repository
----------------------------

Clone the project's repository from GitHub to follow along. Edit the files as necessary to customize the setup.

Step 1: Set Up Serverless Framework Environment
-----------------------------------------------

1.  Install Node.js and npm
    
2.  Install Serverless Framework - “npm install -g serverless”
    
3.  Create a Serverless Framework account and set up an access key for CI/CD usage.
    
4.  Set up CI/CD pipeline multi-stage deployments for DEV and PROD environments
